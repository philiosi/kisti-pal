Section 1.1 'CrystFEL <https://www.desy.de/~twhite/crystfel/>'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* CrystFEL is a suite of programs for processing diffraction data acquired "serially" in a "snapshot" manner, such as when using the technique of Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SFX) with a free-electron laser source. CrystFEL comprises programs for indexing and integrating diffraction patterns, scaling and merging intensities, simulating patterns, calculating figures of merit for the data and visualising the results. Supporting scripts are provided to help at all stages, including importing data into CCP4 for further processing.

Section 1.2 'HTcondor <https://htcondor.org/>'
--------------------------------------------------

* HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS) provides an array of services for automating and managing High Throughput workloads and computing capacity.
