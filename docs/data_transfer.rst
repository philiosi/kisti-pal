Globus Online
-------------------------------

KISTI GSDC has the Globus online endpoints, which are set as pal-ui-el7@gsdc-pal.

Steps to transfer data:
1. Sign up for Globus online and log in (supports CILogon, Google, ORCID iD, globus id).
2. Search for the GSDC-PAL collection using the keyword “gsdc-pal”.
3. Log in with your KISTI account (being able to access your home and group directory).
4. Add your endpoint by downloading and installing “Globus Connect Personal”.
5. Transfer your data from the GSDC-PAL collection to your personal collection.

Please note that the transmission performance of Globus online depends entirely on network conditions. KISTI supports high-performance network infrastructure to provide research resources to approximately 200 R&D institutes.
